# WeatherWear_FE
Frontend of WeatherWear Application


To run, either download the zip and import or clone the repository into your IDE, preferably VS Code
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. VS Code has a built in terminal that should automatically start there
Make sure node is installed
In the terminal window type 'npm install -g npm' 
type 'npm install express' to install express
type 'npm install pg' to install pg

That should work, if it doesn't youre on your own

Once node is installed run 'node server.js' 
Running server.js will start the whole damn project. As long as nothing yucky shows up in your terminal you're straight

In your web browser, type "localhost:3000" to view the interface

The outfit selection or database calls won't work unless you have WeatherWear_BE and the database running as well
